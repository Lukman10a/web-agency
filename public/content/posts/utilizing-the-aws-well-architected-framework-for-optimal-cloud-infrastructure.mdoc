## Introduction

Getting things right at the first time isn't always easy, especially if just starting with DevOps or in the Cloud in general. The AWS Well-Architected Framework was created to assist cloud architects to design and continuously improve their infrastructure in order for it to be secure, efficient, resilient, and cost-effective for their applications.

We at Labyrinth Labs help companies design and build cloud infrastructures. It is crucial for us, that the infrastructures we build are designed according to industry best practices and spec.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides guidance for building and improving cloud architectures. It offers insights into aligning your designs with best practices and enhancing your cloud workloads.

## The 6 Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework Review

The Well-Architected Framework Review is a process that examines six pillars in detail. It identifies potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement, offering actionable steps towards creating a more secure, efficient, and sustainable cloud infrastructure.

### Operational Excellence Pillar

The Operational Excellence pillar concentrates on the effective running of systems and the ongoing improvement of processes. It emphasizes the need to automate changes, respond to events, and establish standards for day-to-day operations. It also encompasses the capacity to efficiently support development and operational workloads, gain operational insights, and continuously refine processes and procedures to add business value.

### Security Pillar

The Security pillar is dedicated to safeguarding information, systems, and assets while also providing business value. It encapsulates important aspects such as maintaining data confidentiality and integrity, managing user access, and implementing controls to detect security incidents. It also involves the development of risk assessments and mitigation strategies to enhance overall security.

### Performance Efficiency Pillar

The Performance Efficiency pillar is centered around the effective use of IT and computing resources. It involves choosing suitable resource types and sizes optimized for workload needs, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs and technologies evolve. It aims to meet requirements efficiently and to maintain that efficiency as demand fluctuates and technologies progress.
